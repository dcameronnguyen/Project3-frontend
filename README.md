## Unsolved Problems

Need to sanitize the search input and also make it so it can't search if undefined.

## Future Enhancements

Want to add page pagination to the search results instead of loading the first 20 relevant searches.

Make the search results just populate a list of cards with game title and image that's clickable to show the details page instead all at once during search.
